# Supporting Material for Diploma Students
This repository holds basic information for diploma students of the HTL Leonding. Besides the hands-on support of the supervisor(s) during the diploma project and while writing the thesis we offer two main support lines for our students:

1. A **workshop** organized for all students of the 4th grade. This is done during the last school week and we introduce to basic scientific working, LaTeX, Zotero, best practice in workflow, etc. The material presented in this workshop is given in [IntroductoryWorkshop](IntroductoryWorkshop/README.md). In this workshop the students are also handed out a [diploma thesis template](Templates/LaTeX) to facilitate their first steps when writing. Along with this template we also organize most of the examples during the workshop.

2. The **Diploma Seminars** which prepare students to present and defend their results. These seminars are held regularly during the 5th grade (mainly while the thesis is written). A very general overview of these seminars is given in [DiplomaSeminars](DiplomaSeminars). Please note that this kind of support is strongly related to the thesis supervisor chosen. So it is strictly recommended to align this part with the supervisor.

Additionally a [LyX Template](Templates/LyX) can be found here. We do not cover or support it but it is offered to the students for judgement. If some of them find it better to work with they may feel free to use it.
