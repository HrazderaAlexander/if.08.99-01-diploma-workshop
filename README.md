# Supporting material for Diploma Students
This repository holds basic information for Diploma Students of the HTL Leonding. Besides the hands-on support of the supervisor we offer two main support lines for our students:

1. A workshop organized for all students of the 4th grade. This is done during the last school week and we introduce to basic scientific working, LaTeX, Zotero, best practice in workflow, etc. The material presented in this workshop is given in [IntroductoryWorkshop](IntroductoryWorkshop/README.md). In this workshop the students are also handed out a [diploma thesis template](Templates/LaTeX) to facilitate their first steps when writing. Along with this template we also organize most of the examples during the workshop.

2. The Diploma Seminars which prepare students to present and defend their results. These seminars are held regularly during the 5th grade. A very brief overview is given in [DiplomaSeminars](DiplomaSeminars).

Additionally a [LyX Template](Templates/LyX) can be found here. We do not cover or support it but it is offered to the students for judgement. If some of them find it better to work with they may feel free to use it.
