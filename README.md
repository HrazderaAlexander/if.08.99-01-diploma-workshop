# Supporting material for Diploma Students
This repository holds basic information for Diploma Students of the HTL Leonding. Besides the hands-on support of the supervisor we offer two main support lines:

1. A workshop organized for all students of the 4th grade. This is done during the last school week and we introduce to basic scientific working, LaTeX, Zotero. The material presented in this workshop is given in [IntroductoryWorkshop](IntroductoryWorkshop)

2. The Diploma Seminars which prepare students to present and defend their results.
