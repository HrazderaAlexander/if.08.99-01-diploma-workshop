# Workshop: Introduction to LaTeX, Zotero, and Scientific Writing

## Overview
In this workshop we want to give our students of the 4th grade some tools to facilitate their way through the preparation of their diploma thesis. Of course, this way already starts during work on their hardware / software projects therefore we discuss different scenarios how to preserve project accomplishments in a way that they can result in well readable chapters of their documentation which is typically done a few weeks or even months later.

Another time consuming step is the creation of a pleasant and uniformly looking title page. So we provide a template to the students where they only have to fill their thesis specific data and a first version of their thesis can be seen already during this workshop.

Furthermore we introduce LaTeX as a professional typesetting software which results in print-ready pdf files. Since we can rely on the fact that the students are already familiar with html as a well-known markup language we do not waste very much time in explaining basic context structuring with \chapter, \section, etc. commands. We mainly concentrate on the following topics:

- Language handling
- Cross referencing
- Floating bodies
- Bibliography handling

The final part of this workshop is dedicated to the general context of the final exam ("Reife und Diplompr√ºfung") and how the thesis is embedded into this.

## Structure
The workshop is divided into an offline and an online phase where atypical for a learning scenario the offline phase takes place *before* the online phase. This is due to the fact that the offline phase has only to do with installing and testing the necessary software.

The online phase then is again divided into two parts, namely one about LaTeX and another one about the embedding of the thesis into the final exam.
