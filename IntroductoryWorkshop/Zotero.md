# Workshop: Introduction to LaTeX, Zotero, and Scientific Writing
## Online Phase Part II: Zotero
When knowledge from external sources (web sites, books, articles, etc.) is taken you have to mention this in your thesis. This is to make clear to the reader what parts of your thesis directly comes from your work and what is knowledge/software/etc. which your work is based on.

Two tasks:

Add external sources into your bibliography database
Whenever you use knowledge from external sources in your text you refer to it correctly.


Go to different websites and add them to the database. Try

Wikipedia
Stack Overflow
Website with meta data (e.g., Ray Wenderlich)
GitHub
Amazon
YouTube
PDF
and inspect the Zotero entries then.

Single-field vs double-field entries to get export right.

Export to BibTeX library (da_bibliography.bib) and inspect the file with a text editor.
